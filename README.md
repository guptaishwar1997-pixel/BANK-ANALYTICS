# BANK-ANALYTICS
1.Project Title:
  Bank Analytics and Credit and Debit
  
 2.Project Objective
   Analyzed banking data to identify key performance indicators such as loan performance, interest revenue, and customer trends. Created interactive dashboards using Power BI/Tableau to visualize insights and          support data-driven decision-making. Utilized SQL and Excel for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

 3. Tech Stack
     🧾 Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and basic analysis
     🗄️ SQL (MySQL) – Data extraction, transformation, and querying
     📊 Power BI / Tableau – Dashboard creation and data visualization

 4.   Data Source
    The project uses two Excel datasets:
    Bank Data Analytics.xlsx – Contains details on loan performance, interest, total fees, and revenue.
    Debit and Credit banking_data.xlsx – Includes customer transaction records such as debit, credit, and account balances.
    These datasets were used for data cleaning, KPI analysis, and dashboard creation in Power BI/Tableau.

      Used Excel filter, aggregate, and transform data.

   3. 📊 Data Analysis
      Identified KPIs such as total loans, interest earned, revenue, and delinquency rate.
      Segmented data by region, loan type, and time period.
      Performed calculations and transformations required for visualizations.
   4. 🖼️ Dashboard Creation
      Designed multiple dashboards in Power BI / Tableau:
      Bank Analytics Dashboard
      Credit and Debit Dashboard
      Added filters and drill-down features for interactive exploration.
